## Server Base System Architecture
**Server Base System Architecture** (SBSA) specification specifies a hardware system architecture based on the Arm 64-bit architecture.
Server system software such as operating systems, hypervisors, and firmware rely on this. It addresses processing element features and key aspects of system architecture.

For more information, download the [SBSA specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0029/i/?lang=en)


## SBSA - Architecture Compliance Suite

SBSA **Architecture Compliance Suite** (ACS) is a collection of self-checking, portable C-based tests.
This suite includes a set of examples of the invariant behaviors that are provided by the SBSA specification, so that implementers can verify if these behaviours have been interpreted correctly.

Most of the tests are executed from UEFI Shell by executing the SBSA UEFI shell application.
A few tests are executed by running the SBSA ACS Linux application which in turn depends on the SBSA ACS Linux kernel module.
The tests can also be executed in a Bare-metal environment. The initialization of the Bare-metal environment is specific to the environment and is out of scope of this document.

## SBSA build steps

### UEFI Shell application

1. Set up edk2 and the Arm toolchain by following the
   [Common UEFI build guide](../common/uefi_build.md).
2. Trigger the SBSA binary generation with:\
   `source ShellPkg/Application/sysarch-acs/tools/scripts/acsbuild.sh sbsa`
3. The build emits `Sbsa.efi` under `Build/Shell/<TOOL_CHAIN_TAG>/AARCH64/`.

### Linux application
1. Peripheral, PCIe, and Memory Map tests that need an OS run through the ACS
   Linux application.
2. Reuse the [Common Linux application guide](../common/linux_build.md)
   for build script usage and arguments.
3. The SBSA artifacts are `sbsa_acs.ko` and `sbsa_app` under `workspace/build/`.

### Baremetal application
The bare-metal build environment is platform-specific.\
For details on generating binaries for bare-metal environments, refer to [README.md](../../pal/baremetal/README.md).


## SBSA run steps

### For UEFI application

#### Silicon System
On a system with a functional USB port:
1. Copy `Sbsa.efi` to a FAT-formatted USB device.
2. In the UEFI shell, refresh mappings with:\
    `map -r`
3. Change to the USB filesystem (for example, `fs0:`).
4. Run `Sbsa.efi` with the required parameters (see [Common CLI arguments](../common/cli_args.md)).
5. Capture the UART console output to a log file for analysis.


**Example**

`Shell> Sbsa.efi -v 2 -m PE,GIC -r S_L3GI_01 -f sbsa_results.log`

Executes only the PE and GIC modules, runs rule `S_L3GI_01`, and writes the
captured output to `sbsa_results.log`.

> SBSA rule IDs follow the `S_L<level><module>_<nn>` pattern documented in
  [SBSA checklist](arm_sbsa_testcase_checklist.md)
  (for example, `S_L3GI_01`, `S_L3PE_02`).\
> Confirm the rule name and ACS level (1–7) in that checklist before applying
  `-r` or `-skip`.\
> Ensure EL3 firmware exposes the registers required by any modules you select
  with `-m` (for example, `RAS`, `MPAM`, or `ETE`).


#### Emulation environment with secondary storage
1. Create a FAT image containing `Sbsa.efi`:\
    `mkfs.vfat -C -n HD0 hda.img 2097152`\
    `sudo mount -o rw,loop=/dev/loop0,uid=$(whoami),gid=$(whoami) hda.img /mnt/sbsa`\
    `sudo cp "<path to application>/Sbsa.efi" /mnt/sbsa/`\
    `sudo umount /mnt/sbsa`\
    *(If `/dev/loop0` is busy, select a free loop device.)*
2. Load the image into the virtual platform or emulator using its documented backdoor method.
3. Boot to the UEFI shell.
4. Refresh filesystem mappings with:\
    `map -r`
5. Switch to the assigned filesystem (`fs<x>:`).
6. Run `Sbsa.efi` with the desired parameters (see [Common CLI arguments](../common/cli_args.md)).
7. Capture the UART console output for certification and debug reports.

### For Linux application

1. Copy `sbsa_acs.ko` and `sbsa_app` to removable media or the DUT.
2. Boot into Linux and mount the media if required.
3. Load the SBSA kernel module:\
    `sudo insmod sbsa_acs.ko`
4. Run the SBSA user-space application (see [Common CLI arguments](../common/cli_args.md)).\
    `./sbsa_app`
5. Remove the SBSA kernel module after the run:\
    `sudo rmmod sbsa_acs`

### Application arguments
Refer to [Common CLI arguments](../common/cli_args.md) for the full flag
list, and use the [User Guide](arm_sbsa_architecture_compliance_user_guide.pdf)
for additional context when constructing command lines.

## Limitations
- Validating the compliance of certain PCIe rules defined in the SBSA specification requires the PCIe end-point to generate specific stimulus during the runtime of the test. Examples of such stimulus are  P2P, PASID, ATC, etc. The tests that requires these stimuli are grouped together in the exerciser module. The exerciser layer is an abstraction layer that enables the integration of hardware capable of generating such stimuli to the test framework.
The details of the hardware or Verification IP which enable these exerciser tests are platform specific and are beyond the scope of this document.

- The MPAM MSC PCC (ACPI Platform Communication Channel) support has been implemented but not yet verified on any platform. Please raise an issue if any failures or errors are encountered during the ACS run.

- S_L8PE_06 requires BRBE to be enabled for Non-Secure EL2 (ENABLE_BRBE_FOR_NS) in TF-A; otherwise EL2 access to BRBE registers traps to EL3.

 #### Tests dependencies
 - MPAM tests will require EL3 firmware to enable access to MPAM registers from lower EL's.
   If arm trusted firmware is used as EL3 fimrware, enable ENABLE_MPAM_FOR_LOWER_ELS=1 during arm TF build.
   If the above flags are not enabled, MPAM tests can lead to exception at EL3.
 - RAS test will require EL3 firmware to enable access to RAS registers from lower EL's and forward RAS related exceptions to lower EL's.
   If arm trusted firmware is used as EL3 fimrware, enable EL3_EXCEPTION_HANDLING=1 RAS_EXTENSION=1 HANDLE_EA_EL3_FIRST=1 RAS_TRAP_LOWER_EL_ERR_ACCESS=0 during arm TF build
   If the above flags are not enabled, RAS tests can lead to exception at EL3.
 - SBSA Future Requirements ETE test will require EL3 firmware to enable access to Trace registers from lower EL's.
   If arm trusted firmware is used as EL3 fimrware, ENABLE_TRF_FOR_NS=1 ENABLE_TRBE_FOR_NS=1 ENABLE_SYS_REG_TRACE_FOR_NS=1 during arm TF build
   If the above flags are not enabled, ETE tests can lead to exception at EL3.
 - MPAM test have dependency on MPAM, SRAT, HMAT, PPTT tables.
 - RAS test have dependency on AEST, RAS2, SRAT, HMAT, PPTT tables.
 - PMU test have dependency on APMT table.
 - Entrophy rule will require ACS to build with NIST-STS package

**Note:** To build the ACS with NIST Statistical Test Suite, see the [arm SBSA_NIST_User_Guide Document](arm_sbsa_nist_user_guide.md)

**Below exerciser capabilities are required by exerciser test.**
- MSI-X interrupt generation.
- Incoming Transaction Monitoring (order, type).
- Initiating transactions from and to the exerciser.
- Ability to check on BDF and register address seen for each configuration address along with access type.

> SBSA Test 803 (Check ECAM Memory accessibility) execution time depends on the system PCIe hierarchy. For systems with multiple ECAMs the time taken to complete can be long which is normal. Please wait until the test completes.
