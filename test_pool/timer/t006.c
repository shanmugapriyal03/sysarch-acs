     Sanity Check: CNTFRQ_EL0 is programmed by the firmware and software relies on it to derive the
     timer resolution. CNTPCT_EL0 is a hardware managed physical counter which progresses at the
     rate mentioned by CNTFID and if scaling is implemented the counter increments based on the
     scale value mentioned in CNTSCR.ScaleVal.

     The purpose of this check is to verify that the observed progression of CNTPCT_EL0 is
     consistent with the frequency reported to software through CNTFRQ_EL0.

                and the independent time delta to estimate the effective frequency of CNTPCT_EL0.
